          <p>Alvarinho produces very aromatic wines, with a higher alcohol range and well balanced acidity.</p>

          <h3>Loureiro&emsp;<a ng-click="play('audio/yeah.mp3')" class="sound"><i class="ion-volume-high"></i></a></h3>
          <p>Although it is a very productive and fertile grape variety, it has only recently been considered "noble". Loureiro's bunches are big and not very compact, while the berries are medium-sized and yellowish or greenish coloured. Loureiro produces
            complex wines, with very strong floral and fruity aromas.</p>

          <h3>Arinto&emsp;<a ng-click="play('audio/yeah.mp3')" class="sound"><i class="ion-volume-high"></i></a></h3>
          <p>Arinto’s bunch is big, compact and made up of small or medium-sized, yellowish berries. This grape variety is usually used in the production of blend (more than one grape variety) and sparkling wines. In the Bucelas region, Arinto produces high
            acidity monovarietal wines (single grape variety), which are citrine coloured and markedly floral and fruity (when young).</p>

          <p>Azal Branco’s bunches are medium-sized and made up of big, compactly placed berries that, when ripened, are greenish coloured. It is a very productive and late-ripening grape variety. Wines made with Azal Branco have fruity aromas, though not
            particularly intense. The wines are very acidulous, which is why the monovarietal Azal Branco are so rare.</p>

          <h3>Trajadura&emsp;<a ng-click="play('audio/yeah.mp3')" class="sound"><i class="ion-volume-high"></i></a></h3>
          <p>This grape variety has good production. Its bunches are medium-sized, very compact and made up of big yellowish green berries. Wines produced with this grape variety don"t have intense aromas and are usually a little unbalanced. Trajadura is
            usually blended with Loureiro or, sometimes, with Alvarinho (grape varieties from the same region and more aromatic), in order to endow the wines with a higher alcohol content and better balance.</p>

          <p>This grape variety has medium-sized, uniform, bluish-black berries. In the Vinhos Verdes region, Vinhão is the most grown red grape variety.  Wines produced with this grape variety have high acidity and are sometimes bitter in red wines.</p>

          <p>Touriga Nacional is of low production: it has many, but small bunches. The berries have a high concentration of sugar, colour and aromas. Wines produced or blended with this grape variety are very balanced, alcoholic and have a good ageing potential.</p>

          <p>In order for the Aragonez qualities to be excellent, its production has to be controlled. Ideal are sandy and carbonate-clayey soils in hot and dry climates, to make the production lower and the berries more concentrated. This grape variety
            produces wines with high alcohol content and low acidity, ideal for ageing, as they are very resistant to rust.</p>

          <p>You will rarely meet it as a single variety, but it forms part of most red Douro blends, contributing dark colour without too much tannin, thanks to its dark but thin skins, along with plummy, cherry fruit. </p>
