            Hot day time temperatures are ameliorated by the cooling effects of the Atlantic Ocean in the evening. In our highest altitude vineyards, the difference in temperature between day and night can be as significant as 18ºC (30ºF). Such wide daily temperatures
            result in longer hang time and more even ripening for the grapes. The early harvest in the microclimate of Amarante assures prime picking times, and minimalizing exposure to autumn rains.

            The viticultural philosophy is of minimum intervention with respect for nature, the grape and the wine. The use of high density planting with low production per vine to extracts the full complexity of each grape. Optimal nutrition and irrigation is applied
            specific to vineyards needs. Sensorial analysis of the grapes is used to evaluate maturation to indicate time for harvesting. Careful selection and collection of each parcel is a core operation for the vinicultural team. Sustainable practices,
            certified by sativa.
