        <p>In order for the Aragonez qualities to be excellent, its production has to be controlled. Ideal are sandy and carbonate-clayey soils in hot and dry climates, to make the production lower and the berries more concentrated. This grape variety produces
          wines with high alcohol content and low acidity, ideal for ageing, as they are very resistant to rust.</p>

        <p>You will rarely meet it as a single variety, but it forms part of most red Douro blends, contributing dark colour without too much tannin, thanks to its dark but thin skins, along with plummy, cherry fruit. </p>
